# Basic Server-Application
This application is based on Loopback and its main purpose is to
support front-end applications with RESTful services which expose data from a database.
It also offers user, authentication and authorisation services to prevent
unwanted access.
Some basic templating with ejs and ejs-mate is also integrated so that it is
possible to implement some basic web pages for server configuration or similar.
